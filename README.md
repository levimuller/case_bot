Case Bot - A basic Python chatbot

I created this basic chatbot in Python for fun. It acts as a virtual version of me, answering a few questions. 

The purpose of the project is to get a feel for developing a custom chatbot, one without using exisiting chatbot or NLP libraries.

It is possible to take this chatbot and greatly expand on it, adding more questions and answers.
